Sality P2P Botnet PCAP Collection

This repository contains packet capture (PCAP) files collected from four virtual machines (VMs) that were part of an active Sality Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnet. The network traffic was recorded in a controlled malware analysis environment to facilitate research on botnet behavior, P2P communication patterns, and intrusion detection.

Overview
The dataset was generated as part of an experimental study conducted in MALBED (Malware Analysis Testbed) to analyze Sality botnet communication. The traffic captures include interactions between infected nodes, command-and-control (C2) communications, and P2P network propagation activities.

These PCAP files are intended for cybersecurity research, network forensics, and botnet detection studies. The dataset supports various analysis tasks, including:

-> Reverse engineering Sality P2P communication
-> Identifying malicious network behavior
-> Evaluating intrusion detection and prevention strategies
-> Developing machine learning models for botnet detection

License & Ethical Considerations
These PCAP files are shared for research and educational purposes only. Any misuse, including attempting to propagate malware outside of a controlled environment, is strictly prohibited. Users are expected to comply with ethical guidelines and legal regulations while analyzing the dataset.
